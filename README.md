# Higher Order Component v.s. "Container"

This is a repo used for my upcoming sharing on React _Higher Order Component_ and something I am trying out and what I call a _Container_ (sorry about the lame name).

I wish to point out that they are essentially equivalent, but provides a different mindset. The difference lies in when, where, and how they let their users pass in and make adjustments to `props`.

I will also talk about how I wish we write our _hoc_ or _container_ in the future. This part is going to be internal.
